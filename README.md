# Hi, I'm Saturn (Jonathan Ribeiro)

Junior Applied AI & Python Developer interested in building practical, human-centered AI systems, at the intersection of software engineering and applied artificial intelligence, focusing on turning unstructured data into usable, structured outputs.
I do care about building things that actually work clean pipelines, clear logic, and responsible use of AI in real-world context (since i'm also an International Relations student)

---

## What I do (usually)
- Build **applied AI projects** using Python
- Train and evaluate **machine learning models** 
- Design **AI pipelines** (input to processing to structured output!!)
- Work with APIs, automation scripts, and data workflows.
---

## Technical focus
- Python for automation, data processing, and AI workflows
- Machine learning foundations:
  - regression, classification, clustering
  - model training, evaluation, and iteration...
- LLM-based systems:
  - prompt design
  - structured output extraction
  - validation and error handling
- Data handling with JSON and basic Pandas / NumPy 

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn (foundations)
- REST APIs
- Git & GitHub
- Basic HTML & CSS

---

## Background
- Computer Engineering student at the **University of Catania (UNICT), Italy**
- Also studying International Relations, with interests in:
  - responsible technology
  - applied AI in real-world systems
  - human-centered and ethical tech

---

## Currently improving!!!
- Applied machine learning foundations
- AI system design and pipelines
- Writing clearer and more maintainable code
