👋 Hi, I'm Saturn (Jonathan Ribeiro)

Junior Applied AI & Python Developer interested in building practical, human-centered AI systems.  
I work at the intersection of software engineering and applied artificial intelligence, focusing on turning unstructured data into usable, structured outputs.

I care about building things that actually work — clean pipelines, clear logic, and responsible use of AI in real-world contexts.

---

## 🚀 What I do
- Build **applied AI projects** using Python
- Design **LLM-based pipelines** (input → processing → structured output)
- Work with APIs, data handling, and automation scripts
- Translate messy text and data into reliable, structured formats

---

## 🧠 Technical focus
- Python for automation and AI workflows
- LLM integration (prompting, parsing, validation)
- Data handling (JSON, basic Pandas/NumPy)
- Clean project structure and reproducible code

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- REST APIs
- Git & GitHub
- Basic HTML & CSS
- scikit-learn (foundations)

---

## 🎓 Background
- Computer Engineering student at the **University of Catania (UNICT), Italy**
- Academic interests: applied AI, software engineering, and responsible technology

---

## 🌱 Currently improving
- Applied machine learning foundations
- AI system design and pipelines
- Writing clearer, more maintainable code
